# Music-Genre-Classifications
The GTZAN genre collection dataset was collected in 2000-2001. It consists of 1000 audio files each having 30 seconds duration. There are 10 classes ( 10 music genres) each containing 100 audio tracks. Each track is in .wav format.



The dataset has the following folders:

Genres original — A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)

Images original — A visual representation for each audio file. One way to classify data is through neural networks because NN’s usually take in some sort of image representation.

2 CSV files — Containing features of the audio files. One file has for each song (30 seconds long) a mean and variance computed over multiple features that can be extracted from an audio file. The other file has the same structure, but the songs are split before into 3 seconds audio files.
